# BASIC Spirit Recorder

This is a basic Spirit recorder made in Java.
Purpose is to improve programming skills in Java.

To make this application (Spirit Recorder) work,
you need to register one emotion per month.

Program was not made to handle jumps in Dates.
Meaning 03 follows 02 following 01 etc...

## How to use the Emotion file
In the Emotion file there are three numbers to use:

A 0 represents the top emotion (feeling good)
A 1 represents the moyen emotion (feeling so so)
A 2 represents the pas super emotion (feeling bad)

## How to use the Date file
In the Date file there is a format to respect,
days go first, then months and years respectively.
dd/mm/yyyy


## Date and Emotion file
The number of elements in the two need to be equal
or the date file needs to have one more element than
the emotion file.
